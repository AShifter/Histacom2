# TimeHACK
## The original hacking simulator!
TimeHACK is a C# version of the PC game Histacom, released by 12padams in 2010. Here are some of our goals:
* Get TimeHACK to the same playable state that Histacom is in.
* Write a new engine and make an API to develop your own applications.
* Create a new Window Manager to make the development of apps easier.

## Building
TimeHACK is currently being developed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Visual Studio 2015 has also been proven to work. If you are using a different IDE, please use caution. We cannot guarantee the stability of other IDEs.

Load the ``.SLN`` project file into Visual Studio and compile. No further steps are required. This list may grow in the future.

## Other Repositories
