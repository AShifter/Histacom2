# Coding Regulations

If you want to contribute, you need to follow these coding regulations for your code to be considered.

## Type names

Please, do not use C# type names. 
In other words, use `string` instead of `String`,
use `bool` rather than `Boolean`, etc.

## camelCase

When you define something private or local, name it using camelCase. However, if it is public, use PascalCase.
